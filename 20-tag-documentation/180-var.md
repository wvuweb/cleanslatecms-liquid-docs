#### `{{ var }}`

A variable is a container for a value. It is a tag that can hold different values at different times.

The official Liquid documentation has a page dedicated to [variables](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/variable/).

### Filter options

See the docs on [`r:set_var`](https://cleanslatecms.wvu.edu/how-to/theme-development/tag-index/r-set-var) and the [official Liquid documentation](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/#filters) to see available filters.

### Examples

**NOTE:** Variable names should use underscores or camelCase. Do not use dashes as CleanSlate can interpret these as "minus" logic.

First, a variable must be created using [`assign` or `capture`](https://cleanslatecms.wvu.edu/how-to/theme-development/tag-index/r-set-var).

```
{% assign bear = "Smokey" %}
```

Then you can use your variable with either object or tag notation. Here's how to use it with object notation:

```
<h2>Hi, {{ bear }}!</h2>
<!-- Output: <h2>Hi, Smokey!<h2> -->
```

Here's how it would be used with tag notation:

```
{% if bear == "Smokey" %}
  Hello, {{ bear }}!
{% endif %}
<!-- Output: "Hello, Smokey!" -->
```

You can also combine variables with filters:

```
{{ bear | upcase }}
<!-- Output: "SMOKEY" -->
```
