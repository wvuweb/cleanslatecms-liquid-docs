# Search

Copy and paste the following code into your theme to implement a site-specific search into your theme:

<!-- Gist embed code, insert via Github Gist Snippet: -->
<!-- Gist Github Username: wvuwebgist -->
<!-- Gist ID: e8a383ee8125a23f14c7b08ff17974d9 -->

**Note:** This code uses the `{{ site.domain }}` tag to get the current URL of the site.

**Note 2:** `.sandbox` domains are not indexed by search engines. Therefore, if you perform a search while your site is in development, no results will be returned. Once you move your site into production, search engines will index your site and search queries will return results.
