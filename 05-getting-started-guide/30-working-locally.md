# Working on CleanSlate themes locally

TODO:

  * Once Steve finishes the local development environment for Liquid in CleanSlate, revisit this page.

As of January 2021, Liquid in CleanSlate does not have a local development environment available. [Hammer VM](https://github.com/wvuweb/hammer-vm) will only work with the Radius templating language.

We're currently exploring options and writing code to make a local development environment available for Liquid. Stay tuned.
